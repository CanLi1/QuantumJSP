# Quantum-Based Job Shop Scheduling

A heuristic approach on how to optimally schedule jobs using a quantum computer.

Given a set of jobs and a finite number of machines, how should we schedule our jobs
on those machines such that all our jobs are completed at the earliest possible time?
This question is the job shop scheduling problem!

## Running the tests

### Simple execution on a chosen dataset

```
python3 demo.py input_file.txt
```
